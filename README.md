Couplets.py

A program utilizing Python 3.4 to run operations on sets of data in couplet
pairs. This is a task commonly utilized in chemistry.

Ex.
There is a set of data consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(Data is always in ascending order).

In sets of couplet pairs you will have [1,2], [3,4], [5,6].

In each couplet, you will subtract the first from the second and then you will
add all the results and divide by the number of couplets, which in this case 
is 3.

You will repeat the process with pairing every other number: [1,3],
[2,4], [3,6].


Requirements to run:

Python 3.4

To Run:

In command line/terminal move into directory that the program is stored in
